# GoGo Vernier Integration Firmware

An integration firmware that enables Vernier wireless sensors to work with GoGo Board 7 using the ESP32C3 chip as a co-processor. Communication between the ESP32C3 and GoGo Board 7 is handled through a serial JSON protocol.

## Overview

This project aims to bridge Vernier Go Direct wireless sensors with the GoGo Board 7 ecosystem. The ESP32C3 acts as a dedicated sensor interface, collecting data from Vernier sensors and transmitting it to the GoGo Board 7 via serial communication using a structured JSON protocol.

## Project Goals

- Enable seamless integration of Vernier wireless sensors with GoGo Board 7
- Provide real-time sensor data communication through JSON protocol
- Support multiple Vernier Go Direct sensor types
- Maintain compatibility with existing GoGo Board 7 programming environment

## Hardware Requirements

- **GoGo Board 7** - Main controller board
- **ESP32C3 module** - Co-processor for Vernier sensor communication
- **Vernier Go Direct sensors** - Compatible wireless sensors

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This project is currently in development. The current codebase contains example Arduino programs for testing Vernier sensor connectivity and Arduino library functionality.

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1** (Current): Testing Vernier sensor Arduino library integration
2. **Phase 2**: Implement JSON serial communication protocol
3. **Phase 3**: Develop GoGo Board 7 integration layer
4. **Phase 4**: Testing and optimization

## Supported Sensors

The firmware will support Vernier Go Direct wireless sensors, including:
- Temperature sensors (GDX-TMP)
- Motion sensors
- Light sensors
- And other Go Direct compatible devices

## Communication Protocol

The ESP32C3 will communicate with GoGo Board 7 using a serial JSON protocol to ensure structured and reliable data exchange.
